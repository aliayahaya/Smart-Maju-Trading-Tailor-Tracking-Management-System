📌 Overview
The **Smart Maju Trading Tailor Track Management System** is a web-based platform developed to digitalize and centralize tailoring operations.  
It replaces manual logbooks with a secure, role-based system that allows **Admins** to create, update, and manage orders, while **Tailors** can update progress in real time.  
The system also provides **management reports** for performance monitoring and decision-making.
